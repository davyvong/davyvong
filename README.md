I'm **Davy**, a software engineer from Toronto, Canada.

I'm fascinated **full-stack development** and currently working as a software engineer at Amazon.

Outside of work, I play a lot of video games or work on personal projects. My current project is a new portfolio website based on another popular UX designer's (iykyk). Check out the progress at https://portfolio.davyvong.com/.
